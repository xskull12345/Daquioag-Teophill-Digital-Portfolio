                <p>
                    <strong>ITEC 23</strong> (Social and Professional Issues in Information Technology) is a key course that covers the influence of technology on <span class="highlight">ethics</span>, <span class="highlight">law</span>, and <span class="highlight">society</span>. I am interested in this subject because IT is playing an increasing role in our lives and we must resolve critical issues like:

                <p>
                    Being aware of these points lets future IT professionals like myself handle new technologies with both <span class="highlight">technical competence</span> and <span class="highlight">ethical consideration</span>.

                <h3>Professional Ethics in Technology</h3>
                <p>
                    Another focus of this course is the significance of behaving ethically in the tech sector. As technology progresses, our ethical frameworks must evolve as well. Key areas that particularly resonate with me include:

                    I want to use what I learn in ITEC 23 to build a strong moral foundation that guides my actions and ensures my work in technology serves the <span class="highlight">greater good</span>.

                <blockquote>
                    "ITEC 23 bridges the technical and the human. What excites me most is learning how to develop technology that <strong>solves real problems</strong> while minimizing potential harm. This knowledge will be crucial as I pursue careers where innovation must balance with social responsibility."
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>
                    The course expands beyond technical material, helping us understand the profound connection between technology and humanity. I'm particularly interested in exploring responsible uses of IT that can address societal challenges while anticipating and mitigating risks. The ethical frameworks I'm developing through this course will shape my approach to technology throughout my career.
