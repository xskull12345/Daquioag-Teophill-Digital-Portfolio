        <h2>Case Study: Sextortion Incident (2022)</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 Summary of the Incident</h3>
        <p>
            In 2022, a 17-year-old Canadian teenager tragically died by suicide after falling victim to a sextortion scam. An online predator pretending to be a teenage girl coerced him into sharing explicit images. The predator then threatened to expose those images to his family and friends unless he paid money. Overwhelmed and terrified, the teen ended his life within hours. This case sparked global concern, prompting the FBI and law enforcement to issue public warnings about the rise in financial sextortion targeting minors.

        <h3>4.2 Ethical Issues Involved</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Violation of Privacy and Consent:</strong> The scammer deceived the victim into sharing intimate content under false pretenses.</li>
            <li><strong>Manipulation and Coercion:</strong> The victim was blackmailed and emotionally harmed.</li>
            <li><strong>Cyberbullying and Psychological Harm:</strong> The threats caused intense emotional distress.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploitation of Minors:</strong> The victim being underage makes the act criminal and unethical.</li>
            <li><strong>Failure of Platforms:</strong> Online services failed to detect or prevent the abuse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.3 Application of Ethical Theories</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Deontology:</strong> The act violated duties to respect persons, tell the truth, and avoid harm. Regardless of outcomes, the predatorâ€™s actions were inherently wrong.</li>
            <li><strong>Utilitarianism:</strong> The emotional and social harm caused to the victim and society far outweighed any benefit, making the act morally indefensible.</li>
            <li><strong>Virtue Ethics:</strong> The predator lacked virtues like honesty, compassion, and responsibility, while platforms failed in their duty to uphold safety.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Contract Theory:</strong> The crime broke the social trust necessary for digital communities to function ethically and safely.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.4 Proposed Ethical Solutions and Interventions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Digital Literacy and Education:</strong> Teach minors about online safety, privacy, and how to report threats.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform Accountability:</strong> Social platforms must implement stronger AI monitoring, reporting tools, and user protection features.</li>
            <li><strong>Stronger Legal Frameworks:</strong> Enact stricter cybercrime laws and foster international cooperation to track and prosecute predators.</li>
            <li><strong>Support Systems:</strong> Ensure mental health resources are accessible for victims and create safe avenues to report sextortion.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical Technology Development:</strong> Apply principles of responsible design and adherence to professional codes of ethics to prevent abuse of technology.</li>
        </ul>
