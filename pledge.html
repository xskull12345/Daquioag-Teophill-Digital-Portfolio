            <h2>My IT Ethics Pledge</h2>
            
            <blockquote>
                "Getting into the field of information technology, I know that expertise in technology is only one side of being a professional. As IT specialists, we have a major task: to protect our users, back up different organizations, and help society. This oath shows what is important to me professionally and reflects how the lessons I have learned will be brought to life in everything I do in my career."
            </blockquote>

            <div class="pledge-item">
                <h3>1. I Will Protect Digital Privacy as a Fundamental Right</h3>
                <p><em>"I will implement and advocate for robust security measures to safeguard personal and sensitive data."</em></p>
                <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> In an era of mass data collection, privacy has become increasingly vulnerable. I believe every individual has the right to control their personal information, and as an IT professional, I must be a guardian of that right. Data breaches don't just cause financial harm—they erode trust in technology itself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pledge-item">
                <h3>2. I Will Build Systems That Are Secure by Design</h3>
                <p><em>"Security will not be an afterthought in any system I develop or maintain."</em></p>
                <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Too often, security is sacrificed for convenience or speed. I've seen how cutting corners leads to vulnerabilities that criminals exploit. By prioritizing security from the ground up, I can help prevent the kind of breaches that harm innocent people.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pledge-item">
                <h3>3. I Will Use My Skills Ethically, Never for Harm</h3>
                <p><em>"I will not engage in or support hacking, unauthorized access, or any activity that compromises systems or data."</em></p>
                <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Technical skills can be used for both good and ill. I choose to align my abilities with ethical purposes—protecting systems rather than attacking them. The temptation to misuse knowledge is real, but integrity must prevail.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pledge-item">
                <h3>4. I Will Be Transparent About Limitations and Risks</h3>
                <p><em>"When implementing technology solutions, I will honestly communicate potential risks and limitations."</em></p>
                <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Overselling technology's capabilities or hiding flaws leads to dangerous overreliance. People deserve to know the truth about the systems they use so they can make informed decisions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pledge-item">
                <h3>5. I Will Advocate for Accessibility and Inclusion</h3>
                <p><em>"The systems I work on will be designed with diverse users in mind, including those with disabilities."</em></p>
                <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Technology should empower everyone, not just the majority. I've seen how exclusionary design can marginalize people, and I'm committed to building solutions that serve all members of society.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pledge-item">
                <h3>6. I Will Continuously Improve My Ethical Awareness</h3>
                <p><em>"I will stay informed about emerging ethical challenges in IT and regularly reflect on my professional conduct."</em></p>
                <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Technology evolves rapidly, and so do its ethical implications. What was acceptable yesterday may be problematic today. Continuous learning is essential to remain an ethical practitioner.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pledge-item">
                <h3>7. I Will Take Responsibility for My Mistakes</h3>
                <p><em>"When errors occur—whether in code, judgment, or implementation—I will acknowledge and correct them promptly."</em></p>
                <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Denying or hiding mistakes in IT can have catastrophic consequences. Accountability builds trust and leads to better outcomes for everyone affected by my work.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pledge-item">
                <h3>8. I Will Consider the Societal Impact of My Work</h3>
                <p><em>"Before implementing any technology solution, I will assess its potential effects on society and vulnerable populations."</em></p>
                <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Technology is never neutral—it always affects people in different ways. I want my work to make society better, not exacerbate existing inequalities.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pledge-item">
                <h3>9. I Will Mentor Others in Ethical Practice</h3>
                <p><em>"I will share my knowledge and experience to help new IT professionals develop strong ethical foundations."</em></p>
                <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Ethical culture is built through leadership and example. By guiding others, I can help shape a generation of conscientious IT professionals.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pledge-item">
                <h3>10. I Will Speak Up Against Unethical Practices</h3>
                <p><em>"If I witness unethical behavior in my organization or profession, I will have the courage to address it through proper channels."</em></p>
                <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Silence enables harm. While whistleblowing can be difficult, it's sometimes necessary to protect the public and maintain professional integrity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="final-commitment">
                <h3>My Commitment</h3>
                <blockquote>
                    "I enter this profession understanding that my technical work has human consequences. This oath represents my dedication to using technology as a force for good, balancing innovation with responsibility, and always remembering that behind every system are people who deserve protection, respect, and ethical consideration."
                </blockquote>
                <p>This oath matters deeply to me because IT isn't just about code and systems—it's about serving people. The choices we make as professionals shape how technology affects lives, and I want mine to be a positive influence in the digital world.</p>
