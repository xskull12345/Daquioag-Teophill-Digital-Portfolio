                        Privacy and access to data without permission were some of the main ethical challenges in the course, highlighted under cybercrime like hacking, identity theft, and tapping someone's phone calls.

                            <strong>Case in Point:</strong> The "ILOVEYOU" virus introduced the difficulties in following laws that do not apply across borders, as well as the legal gaps that existed back then.

                        This made me think about the possible results of some daily digital activities, and how both unintentional and intentional mistakes can greatly hurt others. <span class="highlight">E-Commerce Act</span> and <span class="highlight">RA 9995</span> (Anti-Photo and Video Voyeurism Act) set rules that highlight the role of consent, integrity, and responsibility when working with any digital information.

                        <span class="dropcap">I</span> realized from what happened that I should always consider privacy when developing new products. I discovered that the code of ethics in IT covers additional duties and requires people to consciously uphold users' rights and respect.

                            My goal as I advance as an IT professional is to uphold respectable principles by:
                        </p>
